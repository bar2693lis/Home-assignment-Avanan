## Running the Code

This project is composed of a backend and a frontend, each requiring separate steps to start.

### Running the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd backend
```

Then, start the backend server by running:

```
npm run start
```

The backend server should now be running and listening for requests.

### Running the Frontend
In a separate terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
```

Then, start the frontend development server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

The frontend should now be running and accessible in your web browser.
